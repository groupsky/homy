# CodeQL Advanced Security Analysis
# This workflow performs security and quality analysis on the codebase
# using GitHub's CodeQL engine to detect vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
#
# Supported languages in this repository:
# - JavaScript/TypeScript: Main application code, automations, MQTT services
# - Actions: GitHub Actions workflow files (security scanning for CI/CD pipelines)
#
# Query Suites:
# - security-and-quality: Comprehensive analysis including security vulnerabilities
#   and code quality issues (unused variables, duplicated code, inefficient logic)
#
# Actions Security Scanning (Public Preview):
# Detects workflow vulnerabilities including:
# - Script injection attacks (untrusted input in run commands)
# - Secrets exposure and credential leaks
# - Supply chain attack vectors (malicious actions, dependency confusion)
# - Insecure use of pull_request_target and other dangerous triggers
# - Privilege escalation and GITHUB_TOKEN misuse
